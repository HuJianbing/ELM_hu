# We provide a method to model dynamical systems with extreme learning machine for programming by demonstrations. We provide two kinds of constraints for globally and locally asymptotical stability. For more details, please refers to "Neural Learning of Stable Dynamical Systems based on Extreme Learning Machine, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation".
